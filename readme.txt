The drinkex takes in important, relevant information about you including
- height
- weight
- gender
- number of drinks per week (approx)
- IQ (just kidding)
- hours since most recent meal

as well as information about

- number/type of drinks you've had today
and makes calculations about either
- how drunk you already are

or

- how many drinks it will take you to reach the maximum level of innebriation






IDEAS:
- add cost calculator - based on how much you want to spend
- link it to different places in Boston & their drink's menus
-list available drink sizes
-make a dropdown menu where the user can choose the hour they last ate/time they started drinking.
